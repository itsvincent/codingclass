             Vincent was here!
      This weekend, I will be attending a SAT Class to help improve my test taking skills. It's important for me practice the SAT exam because the score I receive reflects the colleges that may accept me. Although part of my weekend consist on studying, what I look forward to the most is picking my fantasy football team. I am huge football fan and I am ready to draft the best team to win this year fantasy football tournament.
